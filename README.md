## Project Description
### Part I: Green Building Overview
- Exploration of the historical perspective and evolution of Green Buildings.
- Examination of green building components, objectives, and rating systems.

### Part II: Water Management System
- Utilizing IoT-based approaches for environmental applications.
- Leveraging sensor networks for real-time data collection and exchange.
- Continuous monitoring of water quality parameters in a water tank.

## Features
- **IoT Integration**: The project leverages IoT to connect various devices for data exchange and gathering, extending its capabilities to environmental monitoring.
- **Sensor Technology**: Utilizing advanced sensors such as Turbidity and Ultrasonic sensors to monitor water quality and detect physical parameters.
- **Arduino IDE**: Employing Arduino IDE for programming and managing the Arduino boards involved in the project.
- **Blynk IoT Platform**: Incorporating Blynk, a no-code application builder, for easy prototyping, deploying, and interfacing of IoT applications.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Arduino Setup**:
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE suitable for Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
   - Connect the Arduino board to your computer and configure the IDE for the specific board model.

2. **Sensor Integration**:
   - Follow the circuit diagrams provided in the project documentation to connect the Turbidity and Ultrasonic sensors to the Arduino board.

3. **Blynk Integration**:
   - Set up a Blynk account and create a new project for this system.
   - Follow the instructions to integrate Blynk with the Arduino setup.

## Usage
- Once the setup is complete, use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided code sketches to the Arduino board.
- The system will start monitoring the water quality parameters and transmit the data to the Blynk application.
- Use the Blynk app to monitor and analyze the real-time data for water quality management.
